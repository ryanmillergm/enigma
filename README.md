Self assessment:

functionality = 3; crack method was not completed.


Oops =  3; all methods under 8 failed by 2 methods in the cipher decipher classes; encrypt & decrypt.

TDD = 2
most test show before implementation code. However, later on I got caught up and forgot to update commits trying to solve errors.

Version Control - 2

Got lost with commits at one point and ended up losing information due to it.
